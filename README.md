# ao3-poster [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sandalwoodbox/ao3-poster.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sandalwoodbox/ao3-poster)

AO3 Poster was originally designed for podficcers who are trying to upload a backlog of podfic to AO3 that had previously been hosted on other services.
Its focus is therefore on bulk posting data from spreadsheets to AO3 and templating of work text (for cover art, media players, etc.)

Full documentation is at https://ao3-poster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
