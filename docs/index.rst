Welcome to AO3 Poster's documentation!
======================================

AO3 Poster's mission is to make it easier for people to post on AO3.
In particular, it makes it easier to bulk post data from a spreadsheet to AO3 so that you don't have to manually enter data into each field.
This was specifically designed for podficcers.
Their work text tends to be :ref:`templated <work-text-templates>` rather than being the content itself,
which makes it a good candidate for this kind of automation.

.. note:: AO3 Poster currently only supports Mac and Linux computers. If you want to use it on Windows, please consider :ref:`contributing code<contributing-code>`!
